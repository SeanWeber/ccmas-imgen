CCMAS-IMGEN: Creative image generation
======================================

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide through the semestral work CCMAS-IMGEN that was developed during the Computational creativity course at the University of Helsinki (fall 2016).

The first part outlines the overall goals of this project and defines the most important elements of the system. The second chapter describes the implementation of the system, difficulties that were encountered during the development process and used libraries. The subsequent section shows some of the results that we achieved. The fourth part describes the steps that are necessary in order to install and run the application. The final section serves as a list of implemented modules and links to their API documentation.

Team members: Marko Hassinen, Sean Weber, Tomas Duda, Carlos Santana Vega.
